This isn't good- it  is now working hard to try to slow you down. It's begun changing the permissions on files to deny you access.
Whenever you approach a door, you'll have to change the file permission to get through. 
Thankfully, you have sudo access which allows you to change the file permissions. 
WAIT!! You are logged in to an account that isn't in a group or the owner of any files.

This means you'll need to change the file permissions to let ANYONE access them. To get through a door you need to have write permission (2). However, there are also some doors with lasers that will require execute permission (1).

Hopefully you''ll be able to figure out the permissions and continue on to save the worksheet answers.
