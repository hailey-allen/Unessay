# TODO

I've done a couple of things however we still have quite a bit of work to do.
Please add onto this file if you think of anything that we have to do.
Might be a good idea to use that GitHub project feature (GitHub project boards) instead of this file, although this is a decent start.

Things that we still need to do:

- Documentation lol I have like no comments
- Boot splash screen for the image (default is the Godot logo which we will not want in the final game)
- An icon image for the game
- Convert proposal Google docs document to a markdown file to put here in repo.
- Look into the Godot official Git plugin, might come in handy.
- Make at least 3 different levels (tile maps basically).
  - Still trying to figure out auto-tiles right now so they're not set up.
  - There is a barebones level template, no background yet.
- Change the CollisionShape2D node of the player to change based on the animation.
- Make screens for the game (main, pause, end, etc.).
- Make a Theme (might not be exact name) for these screens.
- Make the minigames.
  - Don't remember the ones to implement please add all 3 here.
  - Also need to finalize the concepts of each of these minigames.
- Still not sure if these are the assets we're going to use so please let's talk about this quick so we can finalize our assets.
  - I have some placeholder assets already in place that we might have to change, although I think that the main player asset could work by just saying that Dr. Henry is in a cool, snazzy suit.
  - Might want to make our own basic assets for the terrain, since we're supposed to be in a computer and there is grass there right now (more computery assets).
- Might have to set up Git LFS (look into this further) depending on asset sizes later on.
- Maybe add a double jump?
- MUSIC !!! (audio in general)

Things that we might want to polish if we have the time:

- Maybe implement a Mario style jump where the longer you hold jump the higher you go.
- Coyote time (look this up if you don't know what it is).
- Particle effects
- To be expanded upon
