# Unessay

This is a temporary readme file as we don't really have anything set up yet

Things we could include in this are for example:

- How to launch the game, and controls (even if we end up explaining controls in the actual game)
- Explaining the source files
- Other things I can't think of, will expand later on

Make sure when you import any art assets that are pixelated to use the pre-set "2D Pixel". This is easily done by selecting the images in the "FileSystem" tab in the editor, and then choosing the pre-set "2D Pixel" and clicking re-import in the "Import" tab. This is important otherwise the pixelated assets will come out blurry. (this is all assuming of course that we continue on using pixelated art assets).
