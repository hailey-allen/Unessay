We need a name for the game lol
This is a temporary readme file as we don't really have anything set up yet<br>
Things we could include in this are for example:
- How to launch the game, and controls (even if we end up explaining controls in the actual game)
- Explaining the source files
- Other things I can't think of rn, will expand later on

We should make folders to keep the assets called "assets" and a folder to keep all the source files like scenes and GDscript files called "src".
