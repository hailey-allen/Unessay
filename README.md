For our Unessay project we decided to create a video game called The Virus Assassin, in which the player decides to take on a most villainous malware, which is plotting to take over the mocha server and release all the assignments answers to the students. We implemented the game using a game engine called Godot, which is an open source game engine that can be used to make all types of games. Godot supports a variety of of langauges that can be used to make games, including its own scripting language called GDScript. The overall setting intially takes place inside of mocha where the malevolent malware is running rampant; the player needs to traverse mocha in order to locate hidden malware and defeat them! There will be running dialogue throughout the gameplay nods to concepts learned in class. This running dialogue will also serve an educational role by indicating how the malware is able to interfere with mocha to conduct it’s negative acts and narrating the ways the player hinders these actions. Behaviours of malware learned in class will also determine where the malware is found, as well as what the malware is doing in mocha to steal and release the assignment files.

The only way the player can defeat the malware would be playing through a series of mini-games in-game. Essentially these mini-games were created with concepts taught throughout the class in mind, such as security, privacy and cryptography. One of the mini-games deals with the concept of passwords & password decrytion, within this mini game, the player will attempt to decrypt a number of encrypted/hashed passwords based on knowledge covered at the beginning of the mini game, hints corresponding to each hashed password, and similarities between hashed passwords. Another mini-game would be using the concept of Diffie-Hellman key exchange somewhat and will cover the importance of  public and private keys. In this manner, the mini game will teach the user about keeping their private keys (or what is used to make the private key) absolutely private! The third and final mini game will incorporate file permissions and changing file permissions, as well as how important they can be in maintaining security.


How to play:
Make your way to the end of each level, hitting robots will kill you 
sending back to the start of the level.

To open doors you need write file permission, you are not the owner 
or in the group of the file. Some doors with blue lazers require execute 
permission."
