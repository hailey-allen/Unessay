## Playing the game
If you want to play the game, download the unessay.zip file from releases, extract the two files in the zip file to the same directory, and launch exe.


For our Unessay project we decided to create a video game called "The Virus Assassin", in which the player decides to take on a most villainous malware, which is plotting to take over the mocha server and release all the assignments answers to the students. We implemented the game using a game engine called Godot, which is an open source game engine. Godot supports a variety of of langauges that can be used to make games, including its own scripting language called GDScript which was utilized in the creation of this 2D platformer game. Overall, the game takes place inside of mocha where the malevolent malware is running rampant; thus, the player (Dr. Ryan Henry) needs to traverse mocha in order to locate the hidden malware and defeat it! There is running dialogue throughout the gameplay which makes nods to concepts learned in class. This running dialogue also serves an educational role by indicating how the malware is able to interfere with mocha to conduct it’s negative acts and narrating the ways the player hinders these actions. Behaviours of malware learned in class also determines where the malware is found, as well as what the malware is doing in mocha to steal and release the assignment files.

The only way the player can defeat the malware is by playing through a series of mini-games! Essentially, these mini-games were created with concepts taught throughout the class in mind, such as security, privacy and cryptography. One of the mini-games deals with the concept of passwords and password decrytion. Within this mini game, the player must attempt to decrypt a encrypted/hashed password based on knowledge covered at the beginning of the mini game, hints corresponding to the hashed password, and even small fragments of the password. Another mini-game uses the concept of Diffie-Hellman key exchange and covers the importance of public and private keys. In this manner, the mini game teaches the user about keeping their private keys (or what is used to make the private key) absolutely private! The third and final mini game will incorporate file permissions and the proper altering of them, as well as how important permissions can be in maintaining security.


How to play:

Make your way to the end of each level, hitting robots will kill you 
sending back to the start of the level.

To open doors you need write file permission, you are not the owner 
or in the group of the file. Some doors with blue lasers require execute 
permission.

- WASD / Arrow Keys -- moving the character
- space bar -- Jump
- E -- is to interact with objects
- R -- Reset/Kill yourself
