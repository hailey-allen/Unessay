# Unessay

This is a temporary readme file as we don't really have anything set up yet

If you want to try the game just press the F5 once you open the project.godot file

Always make sure to pull from this repo before you start a new branch to work on the game


Things we could include in this are for example:

- How to launch the game, and controls (even if we end up explaining controls in the actual game)
- Explaining the source files
- Other things I can't think of, will expand later on

Make sure when you import any art assets that are pixelated to use the pre-set "2D Pixel". This is easily done by selecting the images in the "FileSystem" tab in the editor, and then choosing the pre-set "2D Pixel" and clicking re-import in the "Import" tab. This is important otherwise the pixelated assets will come out blurry. (this is all assuming of course that we continue on using pixelated art assets).
